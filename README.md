# File Encryption and Decryption System

## Overview
This project provides a simple yet effective **file encryption and decryption system** using the XOR cipher. It consists of two C programs:

- **`encrypt.c`**: Encrypts a given file using a randomly generated key and produces two output files: an encrypted file and a key file.
- **`decrypt.c`**: Uses the key file to decrypt the encrypted file and recover the original content.

## Features
- ✅ Uses a **one-time pad (OTP)** style XOR encryption for security.
- ✅ Generates a **unique key** for every character in the input file.
- ✅ Supports **encryption and decryption** of any text-based file.
- ✅ Ensures **platform compatibility** with Windows and Linux.

## File Outputs
After running the encryption process, the following files are generated:

- 📄 **`crypt.out`** - The encrypted file containing unreadable data.
- 🔑 **`key.out`** - A key file necessary to decrypt `crypt.out`.

After decryption, the following file is generated:

- 🔓 **`decrypt.out`** - The original file restored from `crypt.out`.

## Compilation Instructions
To compile the encryption and decryption programs, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc encryption.c -o encrypt
gcc decryption.c -o decrypt
```

## Usage

### 🔒 Encryption
To encrypt a file, run:

```sh
./encrypt <filename>
```

Example:

```sh
./encrypt secret.txt
```

This will generate **`crypt.out`** (encrypted content) and **`key.out`** (encryption key).

### 🔓 Decryption
To decrypt a file, run:

```sh
./decrypt crypt.out key.out
```

This will restore the original content in **`decrypt.out`**.

## Error Handling
- 🚨 The program **checks for missing input arguments**.
- 🛑 Handles **file opening errors** and prints relevant error messages.
- ♻️ Ensures proper **cleanup of file resources** to prevent memory leaks.

## Limitations
- ❌ The encryption method is **simple** and not suitable for highly sensitive data.
- ❌ If the **key file is lost**, decryption is impossible.
